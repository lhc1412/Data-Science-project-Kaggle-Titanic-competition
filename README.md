# Kaggle Titanic competition

[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/?utm_medium=partner&utm_source=dataquest.io&utm_campaign=dataquest+kagglefun) is a site where people create algorithms and compete against machine learning practitioners around the world. Your algorithm wins the competition if it's the most accurate on a particular data set.

[The Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) is one of the competition in Kaggle

In this project, I am going to explore a workflow to make competing in the Kaggle Titanic competition easier, using a pipeline of functions to reduce the number of dimensions I need to focus on.

### Summary of results

In this project, I have created a pipeline of functions for the workflow of developing the best model for the Kaggle Titanic competition. So far I have built 3 models with different algorithms and selected the best features for them. 

As the result, the Random Forest Classifier provides the highest accuracy in the K-Fold cross validation, which the score is 0.83. It means its accuracy in predicting the training set is about 83%.
